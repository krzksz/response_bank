## Unreleased

### Changed
- Cache writes build a separate cached-header hash instead of adding
  `Content-Encoding` to the caller's live headers ([#112]).

## [1.3.8] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Brotli splice cache slot handling: reserve fixed-length slots in a
  Brotli-compressed cached response body and splice per-request values into them
  at serve time, without recompressing the body ([#103]).
- `brotli_splice` as a dependency, powering the splice slot support ([#102]).
